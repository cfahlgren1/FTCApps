# The FTC Summary

The FTC Summary was an application build in Python that automated the documentation  process for 
our robotics team. On a daily basis we would haveto manage our engineering notebook and document what happened 
in the meetings and what changes were happening to the robot. The FTC Summary was build to automate that process. 
Basically the FTC Summary takes in the information from the team member and exports it all to an excel document or text
document, automatically formatting it for the engineering notebook. Other features of the FTC Summary are its ability to run
Windows command prompt code, run and save html code, and even autofill users names and date.
